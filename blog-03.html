            <br>
            <h4>Day 1 (7/31)</h4>
            <p>The first day was relaxing. When we arrived at the church, I found that both the natural environment and the dormitories were unexpectedly good, not like the typical volunteer setup at all. If I had known, I wouldn't have brought an extra sleeping bag! (Just kidding.) The first day was mainly about socializing among the volunteers, such as getting to know new friends and ice-breaking activities. I met Ray, who was studying in Canada and had come back to Taiwan specifically to volunteer for the summer. Quickly, Ray, Cola, Van, and I, who already knew each other, started chatting.</p>
  
            <p>After dinner, we did a few volunteer interaction activities. One activity that left a deep impression on me was the first one: the team leader asked us to make a name tag so that the children could recognize and call us by name. After we finished, the leader wanted everyone to stick their name tags on a poster. Because the poster was deliberately not big enough, we all had to trim our name tags a bit. During this process, I saw Tata and some volunteers actively collaborating with those around them, which made me feel that everyone in this team was very enthusiastic and eager to find and devise solutions to problems.</p>
  
            <p>After knowing how to address each other, we played an ice-breaking game. It was quite funny that I couldn't remember everyone's names at that time. The last activity was the little angel and little master game. I was quite troubled by this because my little master was a girl I didn't know (Nana, who I later found out was from our class in Fuxing). I didn't know how to help her. Overall, the first day was very relaxing. I looked forward to meeting the cute children of the reading class the next day!</p>
  
            <h4>Day 2 (8/1)</h4>
            <p>Today started with a volunteer's ice-breaking game. This game was well-designed, allowing the children to get to know each other and us volunteers. It made me realize that a good activity doesn't need to be too complicated; the key is interacting with the children. My first impression of the children was that they were quite cute and more well-behaved and innocent than I had imagined.</p>
  
            <h4>Day 3 ~ Day 7 (8/2 ~ 8/6)</h4>
            <p>Too long to include here :(</p>
  
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As the results exhibition concluded, the moment of parting was approaching. After saying goodbye to the church and the pastor, we dragged our large bags to Hualien Station. Upon arrival, everyone was reluctant to part and cherished the last moments together, taking many photos. When the news came that the train was about to depart, it meant that we had to part with the children. I hugged Jiahe and said goodbye. After taking one last look at the children, I stepped into the train station and couldn't help but cry again. Unexpectedly, on the train, I saw them waving goodbye to us reluctantly. Soon, the train departed, and they chased us until the forest obscured their figures.</p>
