            <h4>Day 1 (7/31)</h4>
            <p>
              The first day was pretty chill. When we arrived at the church, to
              my surprise, I found that both the natural environment and the
              dormitories were decent, not like the typical volunteer setup at
              all. If I had known, I wouldn't have brought an extra sleeping
              bag! The first day was primarily about socializing among the
              volunteers, such as getting to know new friends and ice-breaking
              activities. I met Ray, who was studying in Canada and had come
              back to Taiwan specifically to volunteer for the summer. Quickly,
              Ray, start chatting with Cola, Van, and me, who already knew each
              other.
            </p>

            <p>
              After dinner, we did a few volunteer interaction activities. One
              activity that left a deep impression on me was the first one: the
              team leader asked us to make a name tag so that the children could
              recognize and call us by name. After we finished, the leader
              wanted everyone to stick their name tags on a poster. Because the
              poster was deliberately not big enough, we all had to trim our
              name tags a bit. During this process, I saw volunteers actively
              collaborating with those around them, which made me feel that
              everyone in this team was very devoted to finding solutions to
              problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              After knowing how to address each other, we played an ice-breaking
              game. It was quite funny that I couldn't remember everyone's names
              then. The last activity was the "Little Angel and Little Master"
              game. I was quite troubled by this because my "Little Master" was
              a girl I didn't know. I didn't know how to help her. Overall, the
              first day was very relaxing. I looked forward to meeting the
              cuties (children) next day!
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Day 2 (8/1)</h4>
            <p>
              Today started with a volunteer's ice-breaking game. This game was
              well-designed, allowing the children to get to know each other and
              us volunteers. It made me realize that a good activity doesn't
              need to be too complicated; the key is interacting with the
              children. My first impression of the children was that they were
              quite cute and more well-behaved and innocent than I had imagined.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Day 7 (8/6)</h4>
            <p>
              As the results exhibition concluded, the moment of parting was
              approaching. After saying goodbye to the church and the pastor, we
              dragged our large bags to Hualien Station. Upon departure,
              everyone was reluctant to part and cherished the last moments,
              taking many photos together. Then, the news came that the train
              was about to depart, indicating that we had to part with the
              children. I hugged Jiahe, the children I bonded with the most, and
              waved goodbye. After taking one last look at the children, I
              stepped into the train station, and tears welled up in my eyes. On
              the train, I saw the children waving goodbye to us, jumping up and
              down enthusiastically. Soon, the train departed, and they chased
              us until the forest obscured their figures.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Thoughts</h4>
            <p>
              This 7-day volunteer camp in Hualien has been one of the most
              unforgettable experiences of my life. I stepped out of my comfort
              zone, learned a lot from people, and made lasting connections. As
              we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel a deep gratitude and
              nostalgia.
